## 📝 Implementation Details

### Frontend Components

#### **1. ClassManagementModal.tsx** (NEW)
Full-featured modal for managing class rosters with:

**Features:**
- **Two Tabs:**
  - **Enrolled Students**: Shows current roster with remove buttons
  - **Add Students**: Shows available students with add buttons
- **Search Functionality**: Filter students by name or email
- **Real-time Updates**: Refreshes class list after add/remove operations
- **Student Cards**: Uses existing StudentCard component for consistent UI
- **Error Handling**: Displays success/error messages for all operations

**Props:**
```typescript
{
  isOpen: boolean;
  classOffering: ClassOffering;
  onClose: () => void;
  onRefresh: () => void;
}
```

**Backend Integration:**
- Calls `getEnrolledStudents(offeringId)` to load enrolled students
- Calls `getAllStudentsWithDetails()` to load available students
- Calls `enrollStudent(studentId, offeringId)` to add students
- Calls `removeStudentFromClass(enrollmentId)` to remove students

#### **2. ClassRegistration.tsx** (UPDATED)
Updated the main class management page:

**Changes:**
- Imported `ClassManagementModal` component
- Added `selectedClass` state to track which class is being managed
- Added `showManagementModal` state to control modal visibility
- Updated `handleManageClass()` to open modal with full class object
- Added modal rendering at bottom of component

**User Flow:**
1. Click "Manage Class" button on any ClassCard
2. Modal opens showing class details and enrolled students
3. Switch to "Add Students" tab to see available students
4. Click + to add or × to remove students
5. Close modal - class list refreshes with updated enrollment counts

### Backend Functions (Code.gs)

#### **1. getEnrolledStudents(offeringId)** (NEW)
**Purpose:** Retrieves all students enrolled in a specific class with full details

**Data Flow:**
```
StudentEnrollments (filter by OfferingID)
  → StudentInformation (join on StudentID)
  → Personnel (join on PersonnelID)
  → Return enriched student data
```

**Returns:**
```javascript
{
  success: true,
  data: [
    {
      EnrollmentID: number,
      StudentID: number,
      PersonnelID: number,
      FirstName: string,
      LastName: string,
      PrimaryEmail: string,
      PrimaryPhone: string,
      EnrollmentDate: string,
      CompletionStatus: string,
      CompletionDate: string | null
    }
  ]
}
```

#### **2. removeStudentFromClass(enrollmentId)** (NEW)
**Purpose:** Deletes an enrollment record (removes student from class)

**Data Flow:**
```
StudentEnrollments sheet
  → Find enrollment by EnrollmentID
  → Delete row
  → Return success
```

**Returns:**
```javascript
{
  success: true,
  message: 'Student removed from class successfully'
}
```

**Error Handling:**
- Returns `{ success: false, error: 'Enrollment not found' }` if invalid ID
- Logs all operations and errors

#### **3. enrollStudent(studentId, offeringId)** (EXISTING)
Already existed - used for adding students. Updated to use `CompletionStatus` field.
